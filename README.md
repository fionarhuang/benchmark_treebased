# Performances on toy data

Results are [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/fionarhuang/benchmark_treebased/blob/master/docs/index.html)
BS_1 and BS_2 have similar pattens. BS_2 was tried because `treeSeg` doesn't perform well in `BS_1`
Hope the work is done correctly. Comments, corrections are welcomed.
